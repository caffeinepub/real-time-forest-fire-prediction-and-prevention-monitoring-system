  "summary": "Diff adds an SMS deep-link helper (sms:) and wires SMS actions into the Dashboard officer messaging composer and Officers directory list, plus adds microcopy clarifying sms:/tel:/WhatsApp behavior on the Officers page. However, the requested contact email replacement is not evidenced, and the SMS failure/fallback UX appears incomplete because the SMS helper always resolves success, making the specified failure/error flows effectively unreachable.",

      "id": "REQ-41",
      "requirement": "Replace the contact/credits email address `arinfotech@gmail.com` with `arinfotech1993@gmail.com` everywhere it is displayed or referenced in the frontend UI and repository documentation.",
      "reason": "No diff evidence shows any email string replacement in UI or documentation; none of the modified file excerpts include either email address.",

      "requirement": "If the SMS deep link cannot be initiated or fails, the Dashboard UI shows an inline actionable error state and provides a one-click way to copy the message text (clipboard).",
      "reason": "`sendSms` navigates to the `sms:` link and then always resolves `true` after a delay, so the composer’s `if (!success) { ... }` branch (inline error/copy fallback) is unlikely to ever run except on a thrown exception. This makes the specified failure/error handling effectively not implementable as written.",

      "id": "REQ-43",
      "requirement": "If the SMS deep link cannot be initiated or fails, the Officers Directory list UI provides a clear English error message and a one-click copy-to-clipboard option for the SMS text.",
      "reason": "OfficerList does implement a failure path, but it depends on `sendSms` returning `false`. Since `sendSms` always resolves `true` after setting `window.location.href`, the fallback error/copy-to-clipboard flow is effectively unreachable in normal use.",
