    "Firebase Realtime Database as the real-time data source; must handle empty/null database state gracefully (no data yet).",
    "Sensor inputs expected: temperature, wind, humidity, soil moisture, PIR (human-only intent), flame sensor, MQ2 smoke; GPS lat/long stored for mapping.",
    "Login uses static Admin credentials plus rotating captcha on each load/attempt.",
    "Persist Officers (name, mobile number) to Firebase Realtime Database with CRUD operations; officer messaging reads from this Firebase-backed directory.",
    "Document and standardize the Firebase Realtime Database schema (paths/field names) for sensors, GPS, alerts, and officers; frontend should subscribe to these paths so values appear automatically when data is later created.",
    "Provide a clear, user-facing list of Firebase Realtime Database paths/fields so the database can be created manually in Firebase Console to match the app’s expected schema.",
    "Consider desktop distribution: decide whether to wrap the web app in a desktop shell (e.g., Electron/Tauri) and define build/packaging targets for a Windows .exe.",
    "SMS sending is handled by the Arduino UNO GSM/GPRS module using its attached SIM (9692162224); the same GSM/GPRS module also provides GPS location data used by the app.",
    "Create/initialize the Firebase RTDB schema in Firebase Console with explicit sensor field paths so the Arduino writes values directly to the expected fields (no complex transformation layer)."

    "Firebase Realtime Database currently contains null/no data; UI should support empty-state displays and simulated/demo data if needed.",
    "Add Officer form may incorrectly fail for valid officer name/mobile input and/or Firebase write errors; needs validation + error handling fixes."
