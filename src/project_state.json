  "summary": "Web app for a real-time forest-fire prediction and prevention monitoring system using Firebase Realtime Database (currently empty/null) with dashboards, maps, reports, officer messaging, and admin login flow; officer contact actions should prioritize WhatsApp Calling (no SMS deep links and no device tel: calling links).",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Firebase Realtime Database as the real-time data source; must handle empty/null database state gracefully (no data yet).",
    "Sensor inputs expected: temperature, wind, humidity, soil moisture, PIR (human-only intent), flame sensor, MQ2 smoke; GPS lat/long stored for mapping.",
    "Login uses static Admin credentials plus rotating captcha on each load/attempt.",
    "Persist Officers (name, mobile number) to Firebase Realtime Database with CRUD operations; officer messaging reads from this Firebase-backed directory.",
    "Document and standardize the Firebase Realtime Database schema (paths/field names) for sensors, GPS, alerts, and officers; frontend should subscribe to these paths so values appear automatically when data is later created.",
    "Provide a clear, user-facing list of Firebase Realtime Database paths/fields so the database can be created manually in Firebase Console to match the app’s expected schema.",
    "Consider desktop distribution: decide whether to wrap the web app in a desktop shell (e.g., Electron/Tauri) and define build/packaging targets for a Windows .exe.",
    "SMS sending is handled by the Arduino UNO GSM/GPRS module using its attached SIM (9692162224); the same GSM/GPRS module also provides GPS location data used by the app.",
    "Create/initialize the Firebase RTDB schema in Firebase Console with explicit sensor field paths so the Arduino writes values directly to the expected fields (no complex transformation layer).",
    "Support WhatsApp Web deep links (wa.me / https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=...&text=...) for officer contact actions; calling via WhatsApp Web may be unsupported/inconsistent so UI must handle fallbacks (copy message/number)."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Firebase Realtime Database currently contains null/no data; UI should support empty-state displays and simulated/demo data if needed.",
    "Add Officer form may incorrectly fail for valid officer name/mobile input and/or Firebase write errors; needs validation + error handling fixes.",
    "Officer Messaging UI expectation mismatch: user expects \"Send SMS\" and \"Call Officer\" buttons to send SMS/make calls via the Arduino GSM/GPRS module SIM, but the web app cannot directly trigger the GSM module; UX needs to align with actual capability (copyable payload / tel: link only, or document separate GSM-module-side workflow).",
    "Messaging requirements may conflict: prior scope states the web app should not send SMS (Arduino GSM module handles SMS), but user requests SMS via device sms: link and via WhatsApp Web; needs reconciliation to avoid inconsistent UX.",
    "Requirements change: user requests WhatsApp Calling only and explicitly rejects SMS and device tel: calling links; current planned/implemented contact actions may conflict and need UX alignment."
